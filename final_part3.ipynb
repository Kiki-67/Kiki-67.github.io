    "Employee attrition refers to the leaving of current employees by voluntary or involuntary reasons. \n",

    "The reasons of attrition can be through natural means like retirement, or it can be through resignation, termination of contract, or when a company decides to make a position redundant. However, a involuntary turnover made by the most productive, creative, and engaged employees in the company will cause huge loss of the organization.\n",

    "As a responsible employee, you should not only care about the satisfaction of the customers, but also pay attention to the attrition of your employees. Hence, to prevent the unneccesary attrition, employees should first understand why their employees choose to leave the company and make relative actions to fix the existing problems, so as to create a comfortable environment for the current employees and attract new blood to the company."
